# This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations path.

## The task is to create a clone of the Google homepage

## Instructions
Introduction

For this mini-project, you’ll deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. Don’t worry if the links don’t go anywhere and the search box doesn’t do anything when you submit it. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned. For some of you, this may be the first time you’ve actually tried to “build” something in HTML (very exciting!).

## Outcomes
This project seemed very simple at face value, but in actuality was a bit of a challenge. For lay out I first experimented with css grids, however my implimentation was a little off. After some reflection and more study, I ended up utlizing flex box instead which made it much simpler.

Other challanges were matching properties such as font-style, color and padding. I tried to do as much by eye and educated guesses, which worked for the most part. In a few instances I did peak at the source code to determine the correct settings.

## To-Do
Work on the more difficult version of this challenge which will involves creating a 2nd page with search results for a given query. The challenge instructions recommend this being a static page, but I would like to try and see if I could some how query the actual google from my mock page, and then display actual google results.
